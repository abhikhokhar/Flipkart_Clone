Flipkart Clone
Project Description
This is a Flipkart Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project mimics the basic design and layout of the popular e-commerce website Flipkart, with responsive features, interactive UI elements, and a user-friendly design. The aim of this project is to demonstrate front-end development skills by creating a functional and visually appealing web page.

Features
Responsive Design: The website layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices, offering a smooth user experience on both desktops and mobile devices.
Interactive Components:
Image hover effects for product cards.
Hover effects on buttons like "Login" and "More" for improved UX.
Search bar with a mock-up search icon.
Card Layout for Deals: Display of product deals using a card layout, featuring product images, descriptions, and prices.
Image Slider: A featured product banner with an image slider that includes hover effects and shadowing for depth.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web page and its elements.
CSS3: For styling the layout, adding animations, and ensuring responsive design. Utilized Flexbox for alignment and layout management.
JavaScript: Basic functionality to add interactivity (if applicable).
Google Fonts: Used the "Lato" and "Ubuntu" fonts to enhance typography and readability.

Future Improvements
Add JavaScript functionality for a more dynamic user experience, such as a working search feature, user authentication, and cart functionality.
Implement backend integration with a database to manage product listings and user data.
Enhance the image slider with JavaScript to make it fully functional with auto-scroll and manual navigation.
