Flipkart Clone
Project Description
This project is a simple Flipkart User Interface (UI) Clone built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to replicate the front-end design of Flipkart's homepage and practice web development skills using basic web technologies.

Features
Responsive design for desktop and mobile
Navbar with a logo, links, search bar, and dropdown login menu
A clean and organized structure
Search bar with an embedded lens icon
Dropdown for login, profile, and other options
Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the web pages.
CSS3: For styling and layout.
No frameworks or libraries were usedâ€”just vanilla HTML and CSS!

Future Improvements
Add JavaScript functionality for a more dynamic user experience, such as a working search feature, user authentication, and cart functionality.
Implement backend integration with a database to manage product listings and user data.
Enhance the image slider with JavaScript to make it fully functional with auto-scroll and manual navigation.
